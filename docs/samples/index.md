!!! Important
    The EUC related samples stored in the VMware Samples Exchange have been migrated to the [euc-samples](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples) :simple-github: and are organised according to Platform. Some samples may no longer be present or be located in a different location. Please be patient as we work to provide you with a new format. Alternatively, feel free to contribute your samples to [euc-samples](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples) directly.
    Any samples residing within [euc-samples](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-samples) will be indexed on a 24 hour basis and displayed here.
